#+TITLE: Architecture
* Current Status
Currently the repository is not set up to support github pages. It is simply a set of folders with READMEs and extra content.

* Future plans
I plan to keep the folder setup the same, but add a couple github actions that will organize the content into the github wiki, as well as a custom static site generated with pandoc.
